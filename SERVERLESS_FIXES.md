# Serverless Environment Fixes

## Problem
The backend was failing to deploy on Vercel because it was trying to create directories and access the filesystem, which isn't allowed in serverless environments.

## Error
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/var/task/backend-js/uploads'
```

## Solution
Updated the backend to handle serverless environments properly:

### 1. **File System Operations**
- **Fixed**: `ensureUploadDirectory()` now skips directory creation in production/serverless
- **Result**: No more filesystem errors on Vercel

### 2. **Sample Data Loading**
- **Fixed**: Sample data loading is skipped in production/serverless
- **Result**: No file system access attempts during startup

### 3. **File Uploads**
- **Updated**: Upload route now handles serverless environment
- **Note**: Files are processed in memory (not persisted between deployments)

## Changes Made

### `backend-js/utils/fileUtils.js`
```javascript
// Skip directory creation in serverless environments
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' || process.env.VERCEL) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è  Skipping upload directory creation in production/serverless environment');
  return null;
}
```

### `backend-js/server.js`
```javascript
// Ensure upload directory exists (skipped in production/serverless)
const uploadPath = ensureUploadDirectory();
if (uploadPath) {
  console.log('üìÅ Upload directory ready:', uploadPath);
}

// Load sample data if available (skipped in production/serverless)
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' && !process.env.VERCEL) {
  // ... sample data loading
}
```

### `backend-js/routes/upload.js`
```javascript
// Check if we're in a serverless environment
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' || process.env.VERCEL) {
  console.log('üì§ File upload in production/serverless environment');
}

// Add note about file persistence
note: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'Note: Files are processed in memory and not persisted between deployments' : undefined
```

## What This Means

### ‚úÖ **Deployment Will Work**
- Backend will start successfully on Vercel
- No more filesystem errors
- All API endpoints will function

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **File Upload Limitations**
- **Files are processed in memory** (not saved to disk)
- **Data persists only for the current session**
- **Files are lost when the serverless function ends**

### üîÑ **For Production Use**
Consider implementing:
1. **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Vercel Blob
2. **Database**: Store processed data in a database
3. **File Persistence**: Save files to cloud storage

## Testing

### Local Development
- Directory creation still works
- Sample data loading still works
- File uploads work normally

### Production (Vercel)
- No filesystem operations
- File uploads work (in memory)
- All API endpoints functional

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel** - should work now
2. **Test file uploads** - they'll work but data won't persist
3. **Consider cloud storage** for production file persistence
